#### Hotkeys:
- WIN + ALT + LEFT: Previous Song
- WIN + ALT + RIGHT: Next Song
- WIN + ALT + UP: Volume Up
- WIN + ALT + LEFT: Volume Down
- WIN + ALT + NUMPAD 0: Pause/Resume

Volume adjustment works my changing the volume level of spotify.exe on windows volume mixer, so preferably have Spotify's own volume control set to maximum.
Other hotkeys are done via recreating what message is sent when one of the [taskbar preview buttons](https://i.imgur.com/yyp2ZOO.png) are pressed.

Check the releases for a download.
